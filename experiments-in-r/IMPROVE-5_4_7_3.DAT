        This example is used on page pri473.htm of the e-Handbook
        to demonstrate a response surface design.

Description:  The goal of the experiment was to fit response surface
              models to the two responses
                 1) Deposition Layer Uniformity
                 2) Deposition Layer Stress

              with two controllable factors
                 1) Pressure
                 2) Ratio of the Gaseous Reactants H2 and WF6
                    (called H2/WF6)
