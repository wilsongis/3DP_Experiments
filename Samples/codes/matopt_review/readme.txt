Matopt was originally developed solely for my company, and there were some codes about unpublished algorithms. 
Although, in this version of matopt, such codes were removed as far as possible,
there are still some codes that are not needed to reproduce the results of my study.

Matopt is a wrapper of a Bayesian optimization library, GPyOpt.
Therefore, GPyOpt is required to run matopt (https://github.com/SheffieldML/GPyOpt).
The version of GPyOpt used to develop matopt is 1.2.5.
All the codes are written in python 3.
